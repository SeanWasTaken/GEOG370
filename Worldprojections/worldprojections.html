    <h1>Homework 3: Projections</h1>
    <p>Sean Billy</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>To create the projections I used a shapefile of the world from Natural Earth and added a grid of circles using the Indicatrix Mapper plugin on QGIS.
        When changing the projection in QGIS, the shapefile and circles would change to demonstate how the projection depicts the world.
    </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The circles projeced onto the WGS84 Projection are vertically consistent, however, near the poles they become stretched out on the horizontal.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff Projection is most consistet around the Equator and Prime Meridian. The further the circles get from there, the more warped they become.
    </h3>

    </a>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Mercator Projection keeps the proportions of the circles the same regardless of position. However, as they get further North/South, they become much larger.
        This leads to some locations, such as Greenland or Antarctica, appearing much larger than they actually are on the globe.
    </h3>

    <h2>Winkel I Projection</h2>
        <h3>The Winkel I Projection is similar to the Aitoff, as both projections curve the image to replicate the effects of a globe. The main difference
            between the Winkel I and Aitoff is that the circles on the Winkel I grow larger inare they get further North/South, while those on the Aitoff primarily
            become stretched vertically.

        </a>

        <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
        <h3>Both this projection and the Mercator are cylindrical, with the main difference being the Cylindrical Equal Area projection is squished 
            near the top and bottom, so that the areas remain consistent.</h3>

        <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
        <h3>This is a conic projection from the North Pole, meaning that the further you get from the North Pole, the less accurate it becomes. If you were going to
            be mapping a location in the Southern Hemisphere, this projection would not be a good choice.
        </h3>

        </a>

        <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
        <h3>This projection looks similar to the World Equidistant Conic, but is azimuthal, meaning that the projection is formed by a flat
            plane facing down from the North Pole.
        </h3>

        </a>

        <h2>South Pole Azimuthal Equistant</h2>
        <h3>This projection is the same method as the North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant, but taken from the South Pole instead.</h3>

        </a>

        <h2>World Van Der Grinten</h2>
        <h3>The Van Der Grinten projection reminds me most of the Mercator, as the circles grow in area but do not become skewed. The largest
            differences between the Van Der Grinten and Mercator is that the Van Der Grinten is curved and Antarctica is smaller on the Van Der Grinten.
        </h3>

<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>

<h2>Does Portland's bike infrastructure support all residents or just wealthier ones?</h2>

<h2>Question and Why I chose it</h2>
<p> Something that I'm interested in is moving away from car dependent infrastructure, and a major part of this is building new
    bike infrastructure meant for getting from place to place and not just recreation. I saw that Portland has made large improvements 
    to its bike infrastructure, but wanted to examine if these new investments have benefitted everyone, or just more affluent 
    neighborhoods.

</p>

<h2>Methods Used</h2>
<p>
   From <a href="Portland GIS"> Portland's GIS website</a> I found a CSV of all bike parking and shapefiles for 
   reccomended bike routes, the area covered 
   by the city's bike share program, and the economic vulnerability of residents of different neighborhoods. First I 
   made a 100 meter buffer around all the recommended bike routes and bike parking spots. Next I did the symmetric 
   difference between this buffer and the area covered by the economic vulnerability shapefile to create a polygon with the 
   areas covered by bike infrastructure not included. I dissolved this polygon to make it easier to understand and placed it 
   over the economic vulnerability chloropleth, creating a map of the economic vulnerabilities supported by Portland's 
   bike infrastructure.

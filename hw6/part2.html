<h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Sean Billy</h2>
<h2>Ratio</h2>
<p>The ratio presented on these maps is the Estimated K-12 Enrollment in Private Schools / Estimated K-12 Enrollment. 
    I created this ratio because I felt it would be interesting to see in which counties were private schools most popular. 
    From this ratio I found that in the county I was born in more than a third of the students go to private schools.</p>

<h2>Classification 2: Equal Interval</h2>

    </a>
<p>This ratio is categorized using equal intervals, where the attributes are divided into equal sized ranges. The advantage of this
    method is the creation of an easy to interpret legend, however it causes most data values to fall into one or
    two classes. This disadvantage of equal intervals can be seen on this map, as most counties are a light shade 
    of green, with one county being very dark green.</p>

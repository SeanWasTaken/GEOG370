<h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Sean Billy</h2>
<h2>Ratio</h2>
<p>The ratio presented on these maps is the Estimated K-12 Enrollment in Private Schools / Estimated K-12 Enrollment. 
    I created this ratio because I felt it would be interesting to see in which counties were private schools most popular. 
    From this ratio I found that in the county I was born in more than a third of the students go to private schools.</p>

<h2>Classification 1: Quantiles</h2>

    </a>
<p>This ratio is categorized using quantiles, where an equal amount of items are sorted into every class. This is good for emphasizing
    the position of data in a set, however it can also make small differences appear too great. For example, from the other 
    maps of this ratio we know that counties in north east have a similar ratio, but this categorization makes that appearence 
    appear greater because one of the counties is in the highest grouping.

<h2>Classification 2: Equal Interval</h2>
<a href="Link to Map">
    <img src="NJRatio_EqualInterval.png" alt="Ratio with choropleth classified by equal intervals." width='500px'>
    </a>
<p>This ratio is categorized using equal intervals, where the attributes are divided into equal sized ranges. The advantage of this
    method is the creation of an easy to interpret legend, however it causes most data values to fall into one or
    two classes. This disadvantage of equal intervals can be seen on this map, as most counties are a light shade 
    of green, with one county being very dark green.</p>

<h2>Classification 3: Natural Breaks</h2>
<a href="Link to Map">
    <img src="NJRatio_NatBreaks.png" alt="Ratio with choropleth classified by natural breaks." width='500px'>
    </a>
<p>This ratio is categorized using natural breaks, meaning the items are sorted into groups by the data is naturally arranged 
    into. This method works well with data that is unevenly distributed without being skewed in a direction. 
    The disadvantages of this method are the ranges greatly vary in size and it can be difficult to compare maps created 
    with different natural breaks.
